   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the frontend directory and adding the following variable:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<Your API Base URL>
   ```

   Replace `<Your API Base URL>` with the actual base URL of your API.

   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the backend directory and adding the following variables:

   ```env
